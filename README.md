Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Well app uses:

- This project uses [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) with [Expo](https://expo.dev/) . React Native is a popular framework to build cross-platform apps with JavaScript. Its main advantage is the ability to create cross-platform apps. Expo is a framework to build React Native apps. It is a set with tools and services built for React Native. It helps building React Native apps with ease.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) which is an open source NoSQL database management program. NoSQL is used as an alternative to traditional relational databases. NoSQL databases are quite useful for working with large sets of distributed data. MongoDB is a tool that can manage document-oriented information, store or retrieve information.

- For chatting and live notifications, the app uses [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/) service, a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that lets you store and sync data between your users in realtime.
- For admin and service providers platforms, the app uses [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/), a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is used to build single-page applications.
- For backend and APIs, the app uses [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/), an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.
